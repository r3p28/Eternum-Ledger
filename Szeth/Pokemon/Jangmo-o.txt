                           enemy with a normal ranged attack, striking them for double the amount
                           of damage you took on a successful hit. At 10th Level, you can choose to
                           hold Bide for a second turn for the chance to add additional damage to
                           the attack

                           first instance of this reaction. On future instances of this move in the
                           same combat, you must roll higher than a 15 on a d20 roll for the

     Description       - |
                           You whip your dragon tail at an opponent in an attempt to send them
                           away. Force a target to make a CON save against your Move DC. On a
                           failure, they take 1d10 + MOVE dragon damage and are too frightened by
                           you to remain in battle. In trainer battles, the target must be switched
                           out if another creature is available. In wild battles, the target only
                           flees if it a lower level than the user.
