                     the wielder is hit with an attack, you may use a reaction to add the Pokemon's
                     proficiency bonus to your AC against that attack, potentially causing it to
                     miss.

  Enhancement Bonus       - +0
  Temp Hp Gained          - 23 = 47 (Honedge's HP) * 50%
  Num Moves to Select     - 2

  Selhost's Blight/Gift?? - +2 STAB When Bound, Grants Phasing Strike
  Description             - |
Honedge, as a unique Pokemon situated to be utilized as a weapon, may be wielded as a normal one-handed Shortsword. At Level 10/20 it confers a +1/+2 bonus as a +1/+2 Shortsword to the wielder. Duoblade functions the same but is treated as two one-handed Shortswords. Duoblade also levels up to +1/+2 Bonus at Levels 10/20. Aegislash functions as a +1/+2 Shortsword & Shield. 

The Honedge line can become 'bound' to its wielder as an Action, gaining the bonuses listed below. This may also be done as a Bonus Action by the wielder, and the wielder may unbind as a Bonus Action. If Honedge unbinds, it gains its normal turn back on the following round. All level breakpoints are based on the wielded Honedge/Duoblade/Aegislash.

Honedge loses its own independent actions but granting the following bonuses: 
•    Wielder gains 50/75/100% of Pokemon's current hp as temporary hp at Levels 1/8/16. (Temp HP on Honedge does not count towards this)
•    Wielder selects 1/2/3 of the Pokemon's moves that can be used as if the Pokemon is using it while bound at Levels 1/7/14.
•    The Wielder gains one extra attack during its Attack Action with a Duoblade and gains an extra attack from its Attack Action as well as reaction from Aegislash. Furthermore, the evolutionary line provides an extra attack during an Attack Action at Level 10 as well.
•    The Wielder is able to trigger active feats and abilities as if they were the one using the borrowed Moves, despite otherwise using the Pokemons statistics for the borrowed moves.
•    The Wielder gains Advantage on all Disarm checks against their Bound weapon. If a Move or other source would guarantee a Disarm, the Wielder instead may roll a Dexteriy Saving Throw with *Disadvantage* to beat the DC of the source.

If the user takes damage equal to the Temporary Bonus HP granted, the Pokemon becomes incapacitated for the rest of the scene and gains a level of exhaustion. It still can be used as an inert weapon described above. Temporary HP that was lost is inflicted on the Honedge line after being separated. The Temporary HP does not reset upon being bound & unbound, but does reset upon a short rest.
