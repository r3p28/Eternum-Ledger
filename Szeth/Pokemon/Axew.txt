***** Abilities *****
  1. Name        - Thick Armor
     Source      - This One's Special / Breeding Ability
     Description - |
                     This Axew's plated areas seem thicker than normal. It's capable of using a
                     Reaction to increase it's AC by 3, thus potentially causing a hit attack to
                     miss. This may be done twice per Scene.
  2. Name        - Mold Breaker
     Source      - Starting Ability
     Description - |
                     This Pokémon's moves ignore any abilities or moves that would lessen their
                     effect or ability to hit an opponent (Due to things like Water Absorb, Snow
                     Cloak, Thick Fat, etc.)
***** Feats *****
  1. Name        - Tireless
     Source      - Level 4 Feat
     Description - |
                     Your Pokémon endures hours of rigorous training which keep it in battle longer
                     than the average Pokémon. Gain +1 PP for every move.
